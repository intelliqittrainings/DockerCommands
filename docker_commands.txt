Important Docker commands
================================
Working on Images
======================
1 To download a docker image
  docker pull image_name

2 To upload a docker image into docker hub
  docker push image_name

3 To see the list of all the docker images in docker hub
  docker image ls
  (or)
  docker images

4 To delete a image
  docker rmi image_name/image_id

5 To delete all the unused images,networks,volumes etc
  docker system prune -a

6 To search for a docker image
  docker search image_name

7 To get detailed info about the docker image
  docker inspect image_name/image_id

8 To create a docker image from a container
  docker commit container_name/container_id image_name

9 To create a image from a dockerfile
  docker build -t image_name .

Working on Containers
==========================
10 To see the list of running containers
   docker container ls

11 To see the list of all the contianers running and stopped
   docker ps -a

12 To start a stopped container
   docker start container_name/container_id

13 To stop a running container
   docker stop container_name/container_id

14 To restart a container
   docker restart container_name/container_id
   To restart after 10 seconds
   docker restart -t 10 container_name/container_id

15 To delete a stopped container
   docker rm container_name/container_id

16 To delete a running container
   docker rm -f container_name/container_id

17 To stop all running containers
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

18 To delete all stopped containers
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

19 To delete a containers running and stopped
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

20 To get detailed info about any container
   docker inspect container_name/container_id

21 To see the ports used by a container
   docker port container_name/container_id

22 To see the logs genrated by a container
   docker logs container_name/container_id

23 To execute an application in a container from outside the container
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id command_to_be_executed
   Eg: To open bash shell in an already running container
   docker exec -it container_name/container_id bash

24 To come out of a container without exit
   ctrl+p,ctrl+q

25 To go into a container from which we have come out without exit
   docker attach container_name/container_id

26 To create a container from an image
   docker run image_name/image_id
   Run command options
   --name   This is used to give a name for the container
   -d       Used to run the container in detached mode in the background
   -it      Used to open an interaxtive terminal in the container
   -e       Used for passing environment variables to the container
   -v       Used for attaching a volume to a container
   --volumes-from  Used for sharing volumes between multiple containers
   -p       Used for port mapping.This will link the container port(internal
            port) with the host port(external port)
           Eg: -p 8080:80 Here 8080 is the host port and 80 is the container port
   -P      Used for automatic port mapping ie the container port will be mapped
            with a host port that is greater than 30000
   -rm     Used to delete a container on exit
   --link  Used to create a link between multiple containers so as to create
           a multi container architecture
   --network   Used to start a container on a specific network
   -m         Used to specify the max memory that can be used by a container
   -c         Used to specify the cpus that should be alloted to a container
   -h         Used to specify a hostname to a container

Working on docker networks
===============================
27 To see the list of all the docker networks
   docker network ls

28 To create a new docker network
   docker network create --driver driver_type network_name

28 To get detailed info about a network
   docker network inspect network_name/network_id

29 To delete a network
   docker network rm network_name/network_id

30 To attach a running container to a network
   docker network connect network_name/network_id container_name/container_id

31 To remove a running container from a network
   docker network disconnect network_name/network_id container_name/container_id

Working on docker volumes
===============================
32 To see the list of all the docker volumes
   docker volume ls

33 To create a docker volume
   docker volume create volume_name

34 To get detailed info about a volume
   docker volume inspect volume_name/volume_id

35 To delete a volume
   docker volume rm volume_name/volume_id
